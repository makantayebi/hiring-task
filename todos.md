# TODOs

## Prio 1

- [ ] Decide about the sentiment analysis tool: I don't have a proper GPU; Is it possible to use a free online service?
- [x] run the backend
- [ ] move the backend into a folder
- [ ] There's gonna be a separate react frontend.
      The components are not there, so it needs to be designed.
      Create a frontend. What are the necessary pages and components?
- [x] Setup postgres
